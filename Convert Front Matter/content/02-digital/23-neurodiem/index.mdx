details: 'Neurodiem, a free neurology platform tailored for healthcare professionals,
  predominantly neurologists, offered daily curated medical news and exclusive content
  by esteemed specialists.

  My responsibility encompassed executing ideas, with acquisition metrics as the primary
  focus. Despite facing significant legal constraints imposed by Biogen''''s pharmaceutical
  background, we leveraged UserZoom to conduct user research among similar demographics.
  Over the course of a year, we implemented multiple features and conducted platform
  redesigns.

  While we successfully enhanced the sign-up conversion rate, the challenge of growing
  active user numbers persisted, necessitating sustained marketing efforts. Regrettably,
  Biogen''''s shifting strategy and the considerable cost led to the closure of this
  service.

  This experience underscored the importance of balancing acquisition with delivering
  substantive value to users.'
