details: 'Qima, a leading entity in the quality control supply chain, aimed to digitise
  their workflows to enhance productivity and transparency for their clients.

  My role involved expanding the design team to support the development of an extensive
  web platform, contributing to the recruitment of skilled UI and UX professionals.

  I played a key role in establishing the brand''s creative direction and formalising
  the design process for our team of five talented designers. We developed a comprehensive
  Design System to streamline collaboration with the development team.

  My responsibilities oscillated between UX Design, focusing on wireframes and user
  testing, and UI Design, ensuring consistent visual language across all applications.'
