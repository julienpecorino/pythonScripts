details: 'Running Care is a mobile application designed as a medical device to assist
  runners in injury recovery. It offers potential diagnoses and home-based physical
  therapy exercises tailored to users'' symptoms. In my leadership role, I spearheaded
  product enhancements and process implementation. My responsibilities included conducting
  thorough user testing to pinpoint and resolve issues, leveraging user feedback collection
  to shape the product roadmap, and redefining analytics metrics.

  On the design front, I revamped the UI, introducing a cleaner, more impactful aesthetic,
  and established a Design System to ensure consistency and guide for Developers.

  The team quickly felt the impact of our user-centric process, leading to increased
  productivity and significant product improvements. Positive feedback from runners
  on social media highlighted the success of our efforts. However, a crucial question
  remained regarding the viability of the business model, especially in France, where
  national healthcare covers physical therapy costs.'
