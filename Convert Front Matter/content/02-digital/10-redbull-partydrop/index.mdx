details: 'Red Bull Party Drop is an engaging online game where players are tasked
  with keeping house parties lively by delivering Red Bull. They navigate a miniature
  Red Bull vehicle across the city, requiring quick action and strategy. It''s an
  entertaining game that offers plenty of fun.

  In my role, I collaborated with the team to conceptualize the game''s business logic
  and create the wireframes. I was responsible for creating the 3D model of the Red
  Bull Car, and I also designed the characters and the environment. The game''s city
  is made up of modular elements designed in an isometric perspective, which are pieced
  together to form a vast urban landscape. This game was build in Flash and Papervison
  3d.'
