details: "Universal Music wanted an original interactive Christmas card based on sounds\u2026\
  \ This was perfectly fitting my creative hungriness, I used my Flash experiments\
  \ to propose an unique idea: a geometric shape that could explore the intensity\
  \ of the soundtrack Troika. The result is an interactive 3d shape oscillating on\
  \ the sound wave vibrations."
