details: Nahimic III is a PC software that enhances the audio experience on Gamer's
  computer. It creates a virtual 3D sound effect like if the sound is all around you,
  instrumental when you play games. I've started with the wireframes, made some user
  testing. I've art directed & designed the user interface, building a Design System.
