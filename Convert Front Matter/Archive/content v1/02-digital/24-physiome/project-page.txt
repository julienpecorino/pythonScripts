details:
Physio.me is a specialized physical therapy service catering to patients with neuromuscular diseases. PTs create personalized programs for patients to follow at home.
My responsibilities included enhancing and implementing new features in collaboration with the research team. Additionally, I helped in shaping the product roadmap by introducing a simple prioritization tool for the team.
One of the significant challenges at Biogen was the legal constraints hindering user testing with real users, which considerably slowed our progress. To address this, I developed a decision-making methodology for situations with limited information. Moreover, I applied principles from behavioral psychology to conceptualize more meaningful features.
Measuring impact was challenging due to a small, gradually expanding user base. Adoption among physical therapists was slow, primarily due to their busy schedules and the diverse medical conditions of their patients.
