details:
Commissioned by Subaru, My First Car Story was a Facebook online campaign to launch the new Impreza 2012. Users tell a story about their first car, as they write the app cross matched their text with a database of over 1200 animations to create a beautiful personalised animation. With the help of the CD, I developed a strong & distinctive organic design.
