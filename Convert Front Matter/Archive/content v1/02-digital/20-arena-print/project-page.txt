details:
Arena Print, an American e-commerce website specializing in garment customization, aimed to enhance its revenue streams. Having created the visual design a year prior, I assumed a multifaceted role encompassing user testing, ideation, wireframing, and interface design, alongside frontend development using React.js. Collaborating with my friend John Chipps Harding, a talented creative developer from England, we worked as a cohesive team.
Through comprehensive user research, I focused on discerning customer needs and the intricate details of online printing services. Within a constrained timeframe, we developed a Minimum Viable Product-printing calculator to facilitate order estimation.
We adopted a straightforward approach where customers engaged in live chats with print specialists via Intercom before finalizing purchases. The order is summarized in a simple text format and is now ready on the Intercom chat to initiat the conversation.
This strategy fostered trust and significantly boosted revenue. According to the founder's report, the site now generates $15,000 per week.
