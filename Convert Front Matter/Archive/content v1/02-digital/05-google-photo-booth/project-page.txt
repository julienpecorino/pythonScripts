details:
Google Photo Booth is a fan content generated experiment made during the London 2012 olympic games. Photo Booth is a re-brandable app used for different events. Iâ€™ve worked closely with the developer to give support & clear feedbacks, then through a lot of user testing we delivered a high touch friendly experience.
