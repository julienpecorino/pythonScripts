details:
Universal Music wanted an original interactive Christmas card based on soundsâ€¦ This was perfectly fitting my creative hungriness, I used my Flash experiments to propose an unique idea: a geometric shape that could explore the intensity of the soundtrack Troika. The result is an interactive 3d shape oscillating on the sound wave vibrations.
