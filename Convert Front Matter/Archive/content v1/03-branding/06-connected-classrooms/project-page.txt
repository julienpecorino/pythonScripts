details:
Connected Classrooms aims to connect educative organisations to teachers via Hangout. Through the inbuilt calendar, teachers can find the right video lesson for their classrooms. We’ve created a distinct sub-brand. By twisting the Google red colour into orange we gave a very joyful feeling, the icon design is base on a simple stroke style and the linked ‘OO’ from rooms reflects this idea of connections.
