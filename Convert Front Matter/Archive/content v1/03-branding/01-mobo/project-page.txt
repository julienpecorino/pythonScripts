details:
The MOBO Events are awards in "Music of Black Origin", established in 1996, it is held annually in the United Kingdom. Every year at Delete we used to do create the coming Mobo communication. Iâ€™ve helped the Senior Designer on photo assets and created the main 3d illustration of the Mobo logo for integration in the final poster.
