details: "Connected Classrooms aims to connect educative organisations to teachers\
  \ via Hangout. Through the inbuilt calendar, teachers can find the right video lesson\
  \ for their classrooms. We\u2019ve created a distinct sub-brand. By twisting the\
  \ Google red colour into orange we gave a very joyful feeling, the icon design is\
  \ base on a simple stroke style and the linked \u2018OO\u2019 from rooms reflects\
  \ this idea of connections."
